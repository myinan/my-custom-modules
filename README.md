# my-custom-modules
Custom modules that i have created and published to npm registry. I also store them here, just in case.

**Note:** In order to publish to the npm registry you have to have an npm account and log into that account. With free tier account you can only publish packages publicly. To publish a package publicly use the following command inside the package directory you want to publish : `npm publish --access public`
