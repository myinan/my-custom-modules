A hashSet implementation with JS which stores only keys and no values.

`set` takes single argument, key, and adds the key to the HashSet.

`has` takes a key as an argument and returns true or false based on whether or not the key is in the hash map.

`remove` takes a key as an argument. If the given key is in the hash map, it should remove the key and return true. If the key isnâ€™t in the hash map, it should return false.

`length` returns the number of stored keys in the hash map.

`clear` removes all keys in the hash map.

`keys` returns an array containing all the keys inside the hash map.
